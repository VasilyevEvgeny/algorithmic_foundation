Today Ilya gave Misha a task: to implement a quicksort algorithm. Misha wrote a solution that passed all the tests, but Ilya suspects that the solution is wrong, and in some cases it works very slowly. Help Ilya build a test that can confirm this.

This problem has no input.

Print in one line an array of at most $2000$ positive integers not exceeding $10^9$.

The solution will be considered correct if Misha's program does at least $10^6$ when sorting this array element comparisons.

Below are the program equivalents in various languages.

\SPACE

\noindent C++:
\lstinputlisting[language=C++, style=CodeStyle]{example.cpp}

\SPACE

\noindent Python:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, style=CodeStyle]{example.py}
