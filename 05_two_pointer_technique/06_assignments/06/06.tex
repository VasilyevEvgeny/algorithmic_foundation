Sasha has $n$ sticks with lengths $a_1, \ldots, a_n$. Your task is to determine the number of different obtuse-angled triangles that can be composed of them. Each triangle must be made up of exactly three sticks of the set.

The input data consists of $n$ lines, each of which contains the next number $a_i$. All numbers are natural, all do not exceed $7000$. The number of numbers does not exceed $7000$.

Print the line <<Sasha can compose $k$ triangles>>, where $k$ is the number of obtuse triangles.
