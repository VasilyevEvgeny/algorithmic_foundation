\begin{document}

The store sells two types of goods. Each of the goods of the first type costs aa rubles, and each of the goods of the second type costs bb rubles.

Write a program that considers the number of ways to spend exactly nn rubles in a store. In other words, the program must calculate the number of pairs of non-negative integers $(x, y)$ for which the equality $ax + by = n$ holds.

The only input line contains three integers $n$, $a$, $b$ ($1 \le n, a, b \le 10^5$) - the total amount of money spent and the cost of goods of each of the two types.
