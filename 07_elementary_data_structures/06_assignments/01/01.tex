Given a sequence consisting of round, square and curly brackets. Check if it is the correct bracket sequence.

A sequence $A$ is called a regular bracket sequence if it satisfies one of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is an empty sequence
\item $A = (B)$, where $B$ is the correct bracket sequence
\item $A = [B]$, where $B$ is the correct bracket sequence
\item $A = {B}$, where $B$ is the correct bracket sequence
\item $A = BC$, where $B$ and $C$ are regular bracket sequences
\end{itemize}
A single line of input contains a sequence of parentheses, brackets and square brackets. The length of the sequence does not exceed $10^6$.

Print \textbf{YES} if the sequence is the correct bracket sequence, and \textbf{NO} if not.
