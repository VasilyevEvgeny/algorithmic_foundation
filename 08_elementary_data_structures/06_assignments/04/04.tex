Muller tried many times to catch Stirlitz red-handed, but he all the time twisted. Once Stirlitz was looking through email. At this time, Mueller stealthily entered and saw how a meaningless set of characters appeared on his screen.

Encryption, Muller thought.

UTF-8, thought Stirlitz.

It is known that Stirlitz encrypts text with a simple algorithm: he repeatedly inserts two identical letters into an arbitrary place in the text. You must restore the source text. There are no two identical letters in a row in the source text.

The single line of input contains the Stirlitz encryption, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The encryption length does not exceed $200000$.

Print the recovered text.
