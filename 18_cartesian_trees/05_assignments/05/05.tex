\textbf{Task <<Task planning>>}

There are some set of tasks and one executor. It takes a unit of time to complete one task. Jobs can be executed starting from time $0$. Each job has two characteristics: deadline $d_i$ and fine $w_i$. If the job has not been completed by time $d_i$, a fine of $w_i$ is charged. It is required to complete a certain number of tasks in such a way as to minimize the total penalty received.

\SPACE

\textbf{Input format}

The first line of the input file contains a natural number $n$ -- the number of jobs ($1 \le n \le 100'000$).

The next $n$ lines contain two space-separated integers -- $d_i$ and $w_i$ ($1 \le d_i, w_i \le 10^9$).

\SPACE

\textbf{Output format}

Print one number â€” the minimum total penalty.
