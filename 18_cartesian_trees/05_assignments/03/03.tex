\textbf{Task <<$K$-th maximum>>}

Implement a balanced binary search tree.

Write a program that implements a data structure that allows adding and removing elements, as well as finding the $k$-th maximum.

\SPACE

\textbf{Input format}

The first line of the input file contains an integer $n$ -- the number of commands ($1 \le n \le 100'000$).

The next $n$ lines contain one command each. The command is written as two numbers $c_i$ and $k_i$ are the type and argument of the command, respectively ($|k_i| \le 10^9$). Commands are of three types:
\begin{itemize}
\item +1 (or just 1): Add element with key $k_i$;
\item 0: Find and output $k_i$-th maximum;
\item -1: Remove element with key $k_i$.
\end{itemize}

It is guaranteed that in the course of work in the structure it is not required to store elements with equal keys or delete non-existent elements. It is also guaranteed that when requesting $k_i$-th maximum, it exists.

\SPACE

\textbf{Output format}

For each command of type $0$, print a line containing a single number -- $k_i$-th maximum.
