Given oriented graph. Find the distances from the vertex $x$ to all other vertices of the graph.

The first line of the input contains two positive integers $N$ and $x$ ($1 \le N \le 1 \ 000$, $1 \le x \le N$) -- the number of vertices in the graph and the starting vertex, respectively. Next, in $N$ rows along $N$ numbers, is the graph adjacency matrix: in the $i$-th row, at the $j$-th place, there are $1$ if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to $j$ and $0$ if there is no edge between them. Zeros are on the main diagonal of the matrix.

Print $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$, where $d_i$ is $-1$ if there are no paths between $x$ and $i$, and the minimum distance between $x$ and $i$ otherwise.
