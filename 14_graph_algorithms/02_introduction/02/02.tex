The first line of the input file contains the number $N$ -- the number of vertices ($1 \le N \le 100$). Next are the $N$ lines. The second row contains a description of all edges descending from the $i$-th vertex. The description begins with the number of outgoing edges. The following are the numbers of the vertices to which these edges go. All vertices are numbered by natural numbers from $1$ to $N$. It is guaranteed that the $i$-th adjacency list does not contain the number $i$, and all lists do not contain duplicate numbers.

Derive the adjacency matrix of the directed graph.
