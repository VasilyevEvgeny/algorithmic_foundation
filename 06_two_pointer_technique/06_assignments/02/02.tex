Petya wants to hang a picture on the wall. To do this, he needs to drill a hole in the wall, drive a dowel into it and screw a screw into it. Petya rummaged in the pantry and found $n$ drilled and $m$ dowels. Petya wants to find a drill and a dowel of the same radius. However, such may not be, in this case, he wants to pick up a drill and a dowel so that the difference in their diameters is as small as possible. Help Petya.

The first line of the input contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^5$). The second line contains $n$ integers -- the diameters are verified. The next line contains $m$ integers -- dowel diameters. Diameters are set in non-decreasing order, all diameters are numbers from 1 to $10^9$.

Print the minimum possible difference in drill and dowel diameters
