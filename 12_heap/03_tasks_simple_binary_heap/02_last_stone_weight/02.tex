We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights $x$ and $y$ with $x \le y$.  The result of this smash is:
\begin{itemize}
\item If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
\item If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
\end{itemize}
At the end, there is at most $1$ stone left. Return the weight of this stone (or $0$ if there are no stones left).

\SPACE

\textbf{Example 1:}

\textbf{Input:} [2,7,4,1,8,1]

\textbf{Output:} 1

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,\\
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,\\
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,\\
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.


\textbf{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \le stones.length \le 30$
\item $1 \le stones[i] \le 1000$
\end{itemize}
